## [0.2.2] - 2025-10-28

### Fixed
- **Improved YAML formatting**: Razdfile.yml now has better spacing between sections and tasks

### Added
- **Mise configuration integration in Razdfile.yml**: Define mise tool versions and plugins directly in Razdfile.yml
- **Bidirectional synchronization**: Automatic sync between Razdfile.yml and mise.toml
- **Conflict detection**: Interactive prompts when both files are modified with diff display
- **Automatic backups**: `.backup` files created before sync operations
- **Global `--no-sync` flag**: Skip synchronization for any command
- **`RAZD_NO_SYNC` environment variable**: Disable sync via environment
- Cross-platform file tracking for modification detection (Windows/Linux/macOS)
