All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.6] - 2025-10-29

### Added
- **Semantic change detection**: Mise sync now ignores formatting-only changes (whitespace, blank lines, comments, key order)
- Only semantic content changes (tool versions, task definitions, plugin URLs) trigger synchronization
- Canonical form serialization for both Razdfile.yml and mise.toml before comparison
- `format_version` field in tracking state for future migration support

### Changed
- File tracking system now uses semantic hashes instead of modification timestamps
- Formatting changes in YAML/TOML files no longer prompt for unnecessary syncs
- More intelligent change detection reduces false positives

### Fixed
- Formatting tools (Prettier, YAML formatters) no longer disrupt mise sync workflow
- Manual whitespace adjustments don't trigger sync prompts

## [0.2.5] - 2025-10-29

### Changed
- **Improved Razdfile.yml structure**: `mise:` section now always appears before `tasks:` section
- **Task ordering**: Tasks are now sorted in a logical order: `default`, `install`, `dev`, `build`, then alphabetically
- Better consistency in YAML serialization using IndexMap for ordered fields
- Enhanced synchronization to preserve preferred task order

### Added
- `indexmap` dependency with serde support for ordered configuration maps

## [0.2.4] - 2025-10-28

### Added
- **Interactive backup prompts**: Ask user before creating backups during mise sync operations
- User confirmation for backup when modifying Razdfile.yml or mise.toml
- Better user control over backup file creation

### Changed
- Backup creation now requires user confirmation in interactive mode (Y/n)
- Auto-approve mode still creates backups automatically without prompts

## [0.2.3] - 2025-10-28

### Added
- **`razd up --init` command**: Initialize new Razdfile.yml with project-specific template
- Automatic project type detection (Node.js, Rust, Python, Go, Generic)
- Template generation based on detected project type with appropriate tasks and commands

### Changed
- Improved user experience for project initialization
- Added helpful next steps after Razdfile.yml creation

## [0.2.2] - 2025-10-28

### Fixed
- **Improved YAML formatting**: Razdfile.yml now has better spacing between sections and tasks
- **Auto-sync mise.toml â†’ Razdfile.yml**: When Razdfile has no mise section but mise.toml exists, automatically syncs configuration with user prompt
- Better prompt messaging for mise configuration sync scenarios

### Changed
- Enhanced YAML output formatting with blank lines between top-level sections and task definitions

## [0.2.1] - 2025-10-28

### Added
- **Mise configuration integration in Razdfile.yml**: Define mise tool versions and plugins directly in Razdfile.yml
- **Bidirectional synchronization**: Automatic sync between Razdfile.yml and mise.toml
- **Conflict detection**: Interactive prompts when both files are modified with diff display
- **Automatic backups**: `.backup` files created before sync operations
- **Global `--no-sync` flag**: Skip synchronization for any command
- **`RAZD_NO_SYNC` environment variable**: Disable sync via environment
- Cross-platform file tracking for modification detection (Windows/Linux/macOS)
- Comprehensive test suite with 123 tests covering all sync scenarios
- Documentation for mise configuration in README and examples

### Changed
- All commands (up, dev, build, task, install, setup) now check for mise sync automatically
- `mise.rs` integration prioritizes Razdfile.yml over standalone mise.toml
- Updated examples to demonstrate mise configuration in Razdfile.yml

### Fixed
- Improved error handling for mise configuration parsing
- Better user feedback during sync operations with clear status messages

## [0.1.3] - 2025-10-23

## [0.1.3] - 2025-10-23

### Added
- RELEASE_TOKEN support for GitHub Actions workflows
- Explicit permissions configuration in workflows
- Fallback mechanism for release creation

### Fixed
- GitHub Actions permissions issues for release creation
- Added proper error handling and manual fallback instructions

## [0.1.2] - 2025-10-23

### Fixed
- Simplified release workflow to avoid GitHub API 403 errors
- Removed complex draft/publish flow in favor of direct release creation
- Improved release notes generation
