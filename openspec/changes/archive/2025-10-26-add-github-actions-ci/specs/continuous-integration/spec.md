# Continuous Integration Capability

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Automated Testing Pipeline
The system SHALL provide automated testing across multiple platforms to ensure cross-platform compatibility and code quality.

#### Scenario: Pull Request Validation
```
GIVEN a pull request is opened against the main branch  
WHEN the CI pipeline is triggered
THEN the system SHALL:
- Execute tests on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Run cargo check, test, fmt, and clippy
- Report results as GitHub status checks
- Prevent merge if any checks fail
```

#### Scenario: Cross-Platform Compatibility Testing  
```
GIVEN code changes are pushed to a branch
WHEN CI runs on the build matrix
THEN the system SHALL:
- Test on Windows (latest), macOS (latest), Ubuntu (latest)
- Use stable and MSRV Rust toolchains
- Execute all unit and integration tests
- Report platform-specific test failures
```

### Requirement: Code Quality Enforcement
The system SHALL enforce code quality standards through automated checks and prevent degradation of code quality.

#### Scenario: Code Formatting Validation
```
GIVEN code is submitted in a pull request
WHEN the formatting check runs
THEN the system SHALL:
- Validate code follows rustfmt standards
- Report formatting violations as check failures
- Provide clear instructions for fixing issues
- Block merge until formatting is corrected
```

#### Scenario: Static Analysis and Linting
```
GIVEN code changes are submitted  
WHEN static analysis runs
THEN the system SHALL:
- Execute clippy with strict linting rules
- Check for common Rust anti-patterns
- Identify potential performance issues
- Report findings as actionable feedback
```

### Requirement: Security and Dependency Management
The system SHALL identify security vulnerabilities and manage dependency risks through automated scanning.

#### Scenario: Vulnerability Scanning
```
GIVEN dependencies are present in Cargo.toml
WHEN security audit runs
THEN the system SHALL:
- Scan for known security vulnerabilities
- Check dependency licenses for compatibility
- Report critical security issues as failures
- Provide remediation guidance
```

#### Scenario: Dependency Health Monitoring
```
GIVEN the project has external dependencies
WHEN CI runs on schedule
THEN the system SHALL:
- Check for outdated dependencies
- Identify unmaintained packages
- Monitor for breaking changes
- Alert maintainers of critical issues
```
