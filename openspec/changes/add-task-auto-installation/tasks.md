# Tasks: Add Task Auto-Installation via Mise

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. Extend mise integration module
- [ ] Add `install_specific_tool()` function to `src/integrations/mise.rs`  
- [ ] Add `ensure_tool_available()` function that checks and installs if needed
- [ ] Add proper error handling for tool installation failures
- [ ] Add user feedback during installation process
- [ ] Write unit tests for new mise tool installation functions

### 2. Enhance taskfile integration
- [ ] Modify `setup_project()` in `src/integrations/taskfile.rs` to ensure task is available
- [ ] Update `execute_task()` to ensure task is available before execution  
- [ ] Update `execute_workflow_task()` to ensure task is available before execution
- [ ] Update error messages to guide users when automatic installation fails
- [ ] Write unit tests for enhanced taskfile integration

### 3. Update up command workflow
- [ ] Modify `execute_up_workflow()` in `src/commands/up.rs` to ensure task availability
- [ ] Add progress feedback for tool installation during `razd up`
- [ ] Ensure proper error propagation and user messaging
- [ ] Write integration tests for the enhanced up command workflow

### 4. Cross-platform testing
- [ ] Test tool installation on Windows (PowerShell)
- [ ] Test tool installation on Unix systems (bash/zsh)
- [ ] Verify tool installation works with different mise configurations
- [ ] Test error scenarios (no internet, permission issues, etc.)

### 5. Documentation and examples
- [ ] Update README with information about automatic tool installation
- [ ] Add examples showing the enhanced workflow
- [ ] Update error message documentation
- [ ] Document troubleshooting steps for installation failures

### 6. Integration testing
- [ ] Create integration tests that simulate missing task tool scenarios
- [ ] Test the complete workflow: clone → auto-install task → execute taskfile
- [ ] Test fallback scenarios when mise is not available
- [ ] Validate that existing workflows continue to work unchanged

## Validation Criteria

Each task must meet these criteria before being marked complete:

- **Code quality**: Follows project Rust conventions and passes formatting checks
- **Test coverage**: All new functions have unit tests with >80% coverage
- **Cross-platform**: Works on both Windows and Unix systems
- **Error handling**: Provides clear, actionable error messages
- **Performance**: Minimal overhead when tools are already installed
- **Documentation**: All public APIs documented with examples

## Dependencies

- Task 2 depends on completion of Task 1 (mise integration)
- Task 3 depends on completion of Task 2 (taskfile integration)  
- Tasks 4-6 depend on completion of core implementation (Tasks 1-3)

## Estimated Timeline

- **Tasks 1-3**: Core implementation (2-3 days)
- **Task 4**: Cross-platform testing (1 day)
- **Task 5**: Documentation (1 day)
- **Task 6**: Integration testing (1 day)

**Total estimated effort**: 5-6 days
