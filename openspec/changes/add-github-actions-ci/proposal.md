# Add GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline

## Summary

Implement GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline to automate testing, building, and releasing of the razd CLI tool for Windows and Unix platforms. This enables automated quality assurance, cross-platform binary distribution, and seamless release workflows aligned with the project's cross-platform consistency goals.

## Motivation

Currently, the razd project lacks automated CI/CD infrastructure, which creates several challenges:

1. **Manual testing burden**: Developers must manually test on Windows, macOS, and Linux
2. **Release bottleneck**: Binary compilation and distribution requires manual work
3. **Quality assurance gaps**: No automated testing on pull requests
4. **Inconsistent builds**: Different environments may produce different results
5. **Distribution complexity**: No automated way to publish releases across platforms

The project.md explicitly mentions:
- "Cross-platform testing: Automated testing on Windows, macOS, and Linux"
- "Release process: Semantic versioning with automated releases"
- "Cross-platform consistency: Identical behavior on Windows and Unix systems"

## Proposed Changes

### Core CI/CD Workflow

#### Continuous Integration
- **Pull Request validation**: Automated testing and linting on every PR
- **Cross-platform testing**: Test suite execution on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Code quality checks**: Rustfmt, clippy, and security audits
- **Dependency validation**: Check for security vulnerabilities and license compatibility

#### Release Automation
- **Semantic versioning**: Automated version bumping based on conventional commits
- **Cross-platform builds**: Compile binaries for major platforms (Windows x64, macOS x64/ARM64, Linux x64)
- **Release distribution**: Automated GitHub releases with downloadable binaries
- **Asset packaging**: Create platform-specific archives with proper executables

### Workflow Specifications

#### CI Workflow (`ci.yml`)
- **Triggers**: Push to main, pull requests, scheduled daily runs
- **Matrix strategy**: Test on Windows (latest), macOS (latest), Ubuntu (latest)
- **Rust toolchain**: Stable, beta, and MSRV (Minimum Supported Rust Version)
- **Test coverage**: Unit tests, integration tests, and cross-platform compatibility

#### Release Workflow (`release.yml`) 
- **Triggers**: Git tags matching semantic version pattern (v1.2.3)
- **Build matrix**: Windows x64, macOS x64, macOS ARM64, Linux x64
- **Asset creation**: Platform-specific binaries with proper naming conventions
- **Security**: Signed releases with checksums for integrity verification

### Implementation Approach

1. **Workflow files**: Create `.github/workflows/` directory with CI/CD YAML configs
2. **Build scripts**: Optimize Cargo.toml for release builds with proper metadata
3. **Cross-compilation**: Configure Rust targets for different platforms
4. **Testing strategy**: Ensure tests pass on all target platforms
5. **Documentation**: Update README with build badges and installation instructions

## Impact Assessment

### Benefits
- **Automated quality assurance**: Every change is tested across platforms
- **Faster releases**: One-click releases with proper binary distribution
- **Developer productivity**: Reduced manual testing and build overhead
- **User experience**: Easy installation with pre-built binaries
- **Project credibility**: Professional CI/CD setup increases trust

### Risks
- **Build complexity**: Cross-compilation may introduce platform-specific issues
- **Maintenance overhead**: CI configurations require ongoing maintenance
- **Resource usage**: GitHub Actions minutes consumption for private repos
- **Dependency management**: External actions may introduce security risks

### Migration Strategy
- **Gradual rollout**: Start with basic CI, then add release automation  
- **Backward compatibility**: Existing development workflow remains unchanged
- **Fallback options**: Manual release process remains available if needed
- **Documentation**: Clear instructions for developers on new workflows

## Success Criteria

- **Automated testing**: All tests pass on Windows, macOS, and Linux for every PR
- **Release automation**: Tagged releases automatically produce binaries for all platforms
- **Quality gates**: PRs cannot merge without passing all CI checks
- **Binary distribution**: Users can download platform-specific binaries from GitHub releases
- **Build status visibility**: README displays CI status badges
- **Documentation**: Clear contributor guidelines for CI/CD workflows
- **Performance**: CI runs complete within reasonable time limits (< 10 minutes)
- **Security**: All releases include checksums and are properly signed
