# Design: GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline

## Architecture Overview

The GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline introduces automated infrastructure for testing, building, and releasing the razd CLI tool across multiple platforms. This design ensures consistency with the project's cross-platform goals while maintaining high code quality and streamlined release processes.

## Design Decisions

### Choice of GitHub Actions
**Decision**: Use GitHub Actions as the primary CI/CD platform
**Rationale**: 
- Native integration with GitHub repository
- Excellent cross-platform runner support (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Rich ecosystem of pre-built actions
- Cost-effective for open source projects
- Familiar to most developers

**Alternatives Considered**:
- GitLab CI: Would require repository migration
- Travis CI: Limited free tier, less integrated
- CircleCI: More complex setup, additional cost

### Build Matrix Strategy
**Decision**: Use matrix builds for platform and Rust version combinations
**Architecture**:
```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    os: [windows-latest, macos-latest, ubuntu-latest]
    rust: [stable, beta, 1.70.0]  # MSRV
    exclude:
      - os: windows-latest  
        rust: beta  # Reduce matrix size
```

**Rationale**: 
- Ensures compatibility across all target platforms
- Tests against stable, beta, and MSRV for future compatibility
- Parallel execution reduces total build time
- Excludes unnecessary combinations to optimize resource usage

### Cross-Compilation Approach  
**Decision**: Use native compilation on each platform rather than cross-compilation
**Rationale**:
- Simpler setup and debugging
- Better compatibility with platform-specific dependencies
- Native testing capabilities on each platform
- Avoids cross-compilation toolchain complexity

**Trade-offs**:
- Higher resource usage (3 runners vs 1)
- Longer total build time
- But: More reliable builds and easier maintenance

### Release Automation Strategy
**Decision**: Tag-triggered releases with semantic versioning
**Workflow**:
1. Developer creates git tag (v1.2.3)
2. Release workflow triggers automatically
3. Builds binaries for all platforms in parallel
4. Creates GitHub release with all assets
5. Generates checksums and release notes

**Benefits**:
- Predictable release process
- No manual binary compilation
- Consistent asset naming and packaging
- Automated changelog generation

## Security Considerations

### Build Environment Security
- Use official GitHub-hosted runners for predictable environment
- Pin action versions to specific commits to prevent supply chain attacks
- Validate all inputs to prevent injection attacks
- Use secrets management for sensitive data (signing keys)

### Binary Integrity
- Generate SHA256 checksums for all release binaries
- Future: Code signing for Windows and macOS binaries
- Reproducible builds where possible
- Clear chain of custody from source to binary

### Dependency Management
- Use cargo-audit for vulnerability scanning
- Monitor dependency licenses for compatibility
- Automated dependency updates with testing
- Lockfile validation to prevent tampering

## Performance Considerations

### Build Time Optimization
- **Cargo caching**: Cache `~/.cargo/registry` and `target/` directories
- **Incremental builds**: Reuse compilation artifacts where possible
- **Parallel execution**: Run platform builds concurrently
- **Selective builds**: Only build on relevant code changes

### Resource Management
- **Runner selection**: Use standard runners for most tasks
- **Artifact cleanup**: Remove temporary files after builds
- **Concurrent job limits**: Balance parallelism with resource constraints
- **Build timeout**: Set reasonable limits to prevent runaway builds

## Integration Points

### Repository Integration
- **Branch protection**: Require CI checks before merge
- **Status checks**: Clear feedback on PR status
- **Automated PR validation**: Test all changes before integration
- **Release management**: Seamless tag-to-release pipeline

### Developer Workflow
- **Local development**: No changes to existing development workflow
- **Pre-commit hooks**: Optional local checks matching CI
- **Debugging support**: Easy access to build logs and artifacts
- **Documentation**: Clear guidelines for contributors

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Health Monitoring
- **Build success rates**: Track CI reliability over time
- **Performance metrics**: Monitor build times and resource usage
- **Dependency health**: Regular vulnerability and license scanning
- **Platform compatibility**: Ensure continued support for target platforms

### Maintenance Strategy
- **Action updates**: Regular updates to third-party actions
- **Runner maintenance**: Monitor GitHub runner capabilities
- **Workflow optimization**: Continuous improvement of build times
- **Documentation updates**: Keep CI documentation current

## Migration Plan

### Phase 1: Basic CI
- Implement basic testing pipeline
- Add code quality checks
- Establish PR validation workflow

### Phase 2: Release Automation  
- Add release workflow
- Implement cross-platform builds
- Set up binary distribution

### Phase 3: Optimization
- Optimize build performance
- Add security enhancements
- Implement monitoring and alerting

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **Platform compatibility changes**: GitHub may deprecate runner versions
- **Dependency conflicts**: Cross-platform dependencies may cause issues
- **Build failures**: Flaky tests or environment issues
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing, fallback procedures, monitoring

### Operational Risks
- **Resource limits**: GitHub Actions usage limits
- **Maintenance burden**: CI configurations require ongoing updates
- **Complexity**: Multiple workflows may become difficult to manage
- **Mitigation**: Regular review, documentation, team training

### Security Risks
- **Supply chain attacks**: Compromised third-party actions
- **Credential exposure**: Accidental leakage of secrets
- **Binary tampering**: Unauthorized modification of releases
- **Mitigation**: Security scanning, secret management, signed releases
