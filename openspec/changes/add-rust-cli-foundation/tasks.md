# Implementation Tasks

## Phase 1: Project Setup and Foundation
- [x] Create Rust project with Cargo.toml configuration
- [x] Set up project directory structure (src/, tests/, docs/)
- [x] Configure development dependencies (clap, tokio, etc.)
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline configuration
- [x] Create basic project documentation (README, CONTRIBUTING)

## Phase 2: Core CLI Framework
- [x] Implement main CLI entry point with clap
- [x] Create command structure for all planned commands
- [x] Implement basic argument parsing and validation
- [ ] Add configuration file support (razd.toml)
- [x] Implement logging and error handling framework

## Phase 3: Git Integration
- [x] Research and choose git integration approach (git2-rs vs command execution)
- [x] Implement `razd up <git-url>` command
- [x] Add repository cloning functionality
- [x] Handle authentication scenarios (SSH keys, tokens)
- [x] Add error handling for git operations
- [x] Write unit tests for git integration

## Phase 4: Mise Integration
- [x] Research mise CLI interface and integration options
- [x] Implement `razd install` command
- [x] Add mise tool detection and installation
- [x] Handle mise configuration files (.mise.toml, .tool-versions)
- [x] Add error handling for mise operations
- [ ] Write unit tests for mise integration

## Phase 5: Taskfile Integration
- [x] Research taskfile CLI interface and task discovery
- [x] Implement `razd task [name] [args...]` command
- [x] Add Taskfile.yml parsing and task listing
- [x] Handle task execution with proper argument passing
- [ ] Add support for task dependencies and parallel execution
- [ ] Write unit tests for taskfile integration

## Phase 6: Additional Commands
- [x] Implement `razd setup` command for dependency installation
- [x] Implement `razd init` command for configuration initialization
- [x] Add command completion and help system
- [ ] Implement configuration validation and management

## Phase 7: Testing and Documentation
- [ ] Achieve >80% test coverage across all modules
- [ ] Write integration tests for end-to-end workflows
- [ ] Create comprehensive CLI documentation
- [ ] Add usage examples and best practices guide
- [ ] Performance testing and optimization

## Phase 8: Release Preparation
- [ ] Package and distribution setup (cargo publish, binaries)
- [ ] Version management and release automation
- [ ] Cross-platform testing (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- [ ] Security audit and dependency review
- [ ] Beta testing with target users

## Validation Criteria

Each task should be considered complete when:
- Code is implemented and tested
- Unit tests pass with adequate coverage
- Integration tests validate expected behavior
- Code review is completed
- Documentation is updated
- No blocking issues remain

## Dependencies

- **Phase 2** depends on **Phase 1** (project foundation)
- **Phases 3-5** can be developed in parallel after **Phase 2**
- **Phase 6** depends on **Phases 3-5** (core integrations)
- **Phase 7** can begin after any individual phase is complete
- **Phase 8** depends on **Phase 7** (complete and tested solution)
