# build-system Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change add-github-actions-ci. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Cross-Platform Build Configuration
The system SHALL provide optimized build configurations that produce consistent, high-quality binaries across all target platforms.

#### Scenario: Release Build Optimization
```
GIVEN the release workflow is building binaries
WHEN cargo build --release is executed
THEN the system SHALL:
- Enable Link Time Optimization (LTO) for smaller binaries
- Set codegen-units = 1 for better optimization
- Configure panic = "abort" for release builds
- Apply target-specific optimizations
```

#### Scenario: Cross-Compilation Setup
```
GIVEN different target platforms are specified
WHEN cross-compilation is performed
THEN the system SHALL:
- Install required cross-compilation toolchains
- Configure proper linkers for target platforms
- Handle platform-specific dependencies
- Validate binary compatibility with target systems
```

### Requirement: Build Environment Consistency
The system SHALL ensure reproducible builds across different environments and maintain consistent build outputs.

#### Scenario: Deterministic Build Process
```
GIVEN the same source code and version tag
WHEN builds are executed on different runners
THEN the system SHALL:
- Produce identical binary checksums (excluding metadata)
- Use pinned dependency versions from Cargo.lock
- Configure consistent Rust toolchain versions
- Apply standardized build flags and options
```

#### Scenario: Build Cache Optimization
```
GIVEN repeated builds of similar code
WHEN CI runs cargo build
THEN the system SHALL:
- Cache compiled dependencies between runs
- Reuse incremental compilation artifacts when possible
- Minimize build time while maintaining accuracy
- Clean cache when dependency changes occur
```

### Requirement: Build Artifact Management
The system SHALL properly manage build artifacts and ensure they meet quality standards for distribution.

#### Scenario: Binary Validation and Testing
```
GIVEN binaries are successfully compiled
WHEN validation runs
THEN the system SHALL:
- Execute smoke tests on generated binaries
- Verify command-line interface functionality
- Test basic operations on target platforms
- Confirm no missing runtime dependencies
```

#### Scenario: Artifact Naming and Organization
```
GIVEN multiple platform binaries are generated
WHEN artifacts are prepared for release
THEN the system SHALL:
- Use consistent naming convention (razd-v1.2.3-windows-x64.zip)
- Include version information in filenames
- Organize artifacts by platform and architecture
- Maintain metadata about build environment
```

### Requirement: Build Performance and Resource Management
The system SHALL optimize build performance while managing CI resources efficiently.

#### Scenario: Parallel Build Execution
```
GIVEN multiple platforms need compilation
WHEN release workflow runs
THEN the system SHALL:
- Execute platform builds in parallel when possible
- Balance resource usage across GitHub Actions runners
- Complete all builds within reasonable time limits (< 20 minutes)
- Handle build failures gracefully without blocking other platforms
```

#### Scenario: Resource Usage Optimization
```
GIVEN limited CI resources are available
WHEN builds are executed
THEN the system SHALL:
- Use appropriate runner sizes for build complexity
- Clean up temporary artifacts after completion
- Monitor and report resource usage metrics
- Implement build time optimizations
```
