# release-automation Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change add-github-actions-ci. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Cross-Platform Binary Generation
The system SHALL automatically generate platform-specific binaries for major operating systems when releases are tagged.

#### Scenario: Multi-Platform Build Matrix
```
GIVEN a semantic version tag is pushed (e.g., v1.2.3)
WHEN the release workflow is triggered
THEN the system SHALL:
- Build binaries for Windows x64, macOS x64, macOS ARM64, Linux x64
- Use optimized release configuration with LTO
- Generate platform-appropriate executable names (razd.exe for Windows)
- Create compressed archives for distribution
```

#### Scenario: Binary Optimization and Packaging
```
GIVEN binaries are successfully compiled
WHEN packaging occurs
THEN the system SHALL:
- Strip debug symbols from release binaries
- Apply compression to reduce file size
- Include necessary runtime dependencies
- Create platform-specific archive formats (zip, tar.gz)
```

### Requirement: Automated Release Management
The system SHALL manage the complete release lifecycle from tagging to distribution without manual intervention.

#### Scenario: Semantic Version Release Creation
```
GIVEN a git tag matching pattern v*.*.* is pushed
WHEN release automation runs
THEN the system SHALL:
- Parse version from git tag
- Generate release notes from commit history
- Create GitHub release with proper metadata
- Attach all platform binaries as downloadable assets
```

#### Scenario: Release Asset Integrity
```
GIVEN release binaries are generated
WHEN assets are uploaded to GitHub
THEN the system SHALL:
- Calculate SHA256 checksums for all binaries
- Create checksums.txt file with hash values
- Sign releases with appropriate keys
- Provide verification instructions in release notes
```

### Requirement: Version Management and Changelog
The system SHALL manage versioning and maintain comprehensive changelog documentation.

#### Scenario: Automated Changelog Generation
```
GIVEN commits follow conventional commit format
WHEN a release is created
THEN the system SHALL:
- Generate changelog from commit messages
- Categorize changes (features, fixes, breaking changes)
- Include contributor acknowledgments
- Format changelog for human readability
```

#### Scenario: Pre-release and Release Channels
```
GIVEN different version tag formats
WHEN release workflow detects tag type
THEN the system SHALL:
- Create pre-releases for tags with suffixes (v1.0.0-beta.1)
- Mark stable releases for standard semantic versions
- Configure appropriate release settings
- Notify different distribution channels
```

### Requirement: Distribution and Installation Support
The system SHALL provide multiple installation methods and clear distribution channels for end users.

#### Scenario: GitHub Releases Distribution
```
GIVEN a release is successfully created  
WHEN users access the GitHub releases page
THEN the system SHALL:
- Provide clear download links for each platform
- Include installation instructions in README
- Display latest release prominently
- Maintain historical releases for compatibility
```

#### Scenario: Package Manager Preparation
```
GIVEN release binaries are available
WHEN distribution metadata is generated
THEN the system SHALL:
- Create metadata suitable for package managers
- Generate proper version manifests
- Include dependency information
- Prepare for future package manager integration
```
