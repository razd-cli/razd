# task-auto-installation Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change add-task-auto-installation. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: TASK_AUTO_INSTALL - System SHALL automatically install task tool when missing
The system SHALL automatically ensure the `task` tool is available before executing taskfile operations by installing it via mise when necessary.

#### Scenario: Task tool missing during razd up
**Given** a project directory with Taskfile.yml configuration  
**And** the `task` tool is not installed or not available in PATH  
**And** `mise` is installed and functional  
**When** user executes `razd up`  
**Then** the system should automatically run `mise install task@latest`  
**And** verify that `task` is now available  
**And** continue with normal taskfile operations  
**And** display progress feedback during installation

#### Scenario: Task tool already available
**Given** a project directory with Taskfile.yml configuration  
**And** the `task` tool is already installed and available in PATH  
**When** user executes `razd up`  
**Then** the system should skip task installation  
**And** proceed directly to taskfile operations  
**And** complete successfully without additional overhead

#### Scenario: Mise not available for task installation
**Given** a project directory with Taskfile.yml configuration  
**And** the `task` tool is not installed or not available in PATH  
**And** `mise` is not installed or not functional  
**When** user executes `razd up`  
**Then** the system should display a clear error message  
**And** guide the user to manually install `task`  
**And** provide installation instructions URL  
**And** exit with appropriate error code

### Requirement: TASK_AUTO_VERIFY - System SHALL verify installed tool functionality
The system SHALL verify that automatically installed tools are functional before proceeding with operations.

#### Scenario: Successful tool installation verification
**Given** `task` tool was just installed via `mise install task@latest`  
**When** the system verifies tool availability  
**Then** it should execute `task --version` successfully  
**And** confirm the tool is functional  
**And** proceed with taskfile operations

#### Scenario: Tool installation verification failure
**Given** `task` tool installation via mise appeared to succeed  
**But** the tool is not actually functional or accessible  
**When** the system verifies tool availability  
**Then** it should detect the verification failure  
**And** display a clear error message about installation problems  
**And** provide troubleshooting guidance  
**And** exit with appropriate error code

### Requirement: TASK_AUTO_FEEDBACK - System SHALL provide installation progress feedback
The system SHALL provide clear feedback to users during automatic tool installation processes.

#### Scenario: Tool installation with progress feedback
**Given** the system needs to install `task` via mise  
**When** the installation process begins  
**Then** it should display "Installing task tool via mise..."  
**And** show installation progress or completion status  
**And** display "âœ“ Task tool installed successfully" upon completion  
**And** continue with clear indication of next steps

#### Scenario: Tool installation failure feedback
**Given** the system attempts to install `task` via mise  
**And** the installation fails due to network or configuration issues  
**When** the installation fails  
**Then** it should display clear error message about installation failure  
**And** include the specific error details from mise  
**And** provide next steps for manual resolution  
**And** exit gracefully with error code

### Requirement: TASK_AUTO_CROSS_PLATFORM - System SHALL work on Windows and Unix platforms
The system SHALL reliably install and verify tools on both Windows and Unix platforms.

#### Scenario: Task installation on Windows
**Given** running on Windows with PowerShell  
**And** mise is properly configured  
**When** automatic task installation is triggered  
**Then** it should execute `mise install task@latest` successfully  
**And** verify task accessibility in Windows PATH  
**And** work with Windows file system paths and permissions

#### Scenario: Task installation on Unix systems
**Given** running on Unix system (Linux/macOS) with bash/zsh  
**And** mise is properly configured  
**When** automatic task installation is triggered  
**Then** it should execute `mise install task@latest` successfully  
**And** verify task accessibility in Unix PATH  
**And** work with Unix file system paths and permissions
