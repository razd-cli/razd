# cli-interface Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change add-rust-cli-foundation. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Primary CLI Commands
The razd CLI MUST provide core commands for project lifecycle management.

#### Scenario: Project initialization with razd up
**Given** a user wants to set up a new project from a git repository  
**When** they run `razd up https://github.com/hello/world.git`  
**Then** the system should:
- Clone the repository to the current directory
- Change to the cloned directory
- Run `mise install` to install development tools
- Run `task setup` to install project dependencies
- Display success message with next steps

#### Scenario: Tool installation with razd install
**Given** a user is in a project directory with mise configuration  
**When** they run `razd install`  
**Then** the system should execute `mise install` and display the results

#### Scenario: Dependency setup with razd setup
**Given** a user is in a project directory with a Taskfile.yml  
**When** they run `razd setup`  
**Then** the system should execute `task setup` and display the results

#### Scenario: Task execution with specific task name
**Given** a user is in a project directory with a Taskfile.yml containing tasks  
**When** they run `razd task build --verbose`  
**Then** the system should execute `task build --verbose` and display the results

#### Scenario: Task execution with no arguments (dev server fallback)
**Given** a user is in a project directory with a Taskfile.yml  
**When** they run `razd task` with no arguments  
**Then** the system should execute `task` (which typically starts a development server)

#### Scenario: Configuration initialization with razd init
**Given** a user is in a project directory  
**When** they run `razd init`  
**Then** the system should create razd configuration files for the project

### Requirement: Cross-platform compatibility
The razd CLI MUST work identically on Windows and Unix systems.

#### Scenario: Windows PowerShell execution
**Given** a user is running razd on Windows with PowerShell  
**When** they execute any razd command  
**Then** the command should work without modification and produce the same results as on Unix systems

#### Scenario: Unix shell execution
**Given** a user is running razd on a Unix system (Linux/macOS)  
**When** they execute any razd command  
**Then** the command should work without modification and produce the same results as on Windows

### Requirement: Error handling and user feedback
The CLI MUST provide clear error messages and helpful guidance.

#### Scenario: Invalid git URL
**Given** a user provides an invalid or inaccessible git URL  
**When** they run `razd up invalid-url`  
**Then** the system should display a clear error message and suggest valid URL formats

#### Scenario: Missing dependencies
**Given** mise or taskfile is not installed on the system  
**When** a user runs a command that requires these tools  
**Then** the system should display installation instructions for the missing tools

#### Scenario: Command execution in wrong directory
**Given** a user runs `razd install` or `razd setup` in a directory without appropriate configuration files  
**When** the command executes  
**Then** the system should display a helpful error message explaining what files are needed

### Requirement: Help and documentation
The CLI MUST provide comprehensive help information.

#### Scenario: General help display
**Given** a user wants to learn about razd commands  
**When** they run `razd --help` or `razd -h`  
**Then** the system should display all available commands with brief descriptions

#### Scenario: Command-specific help
**Given** a user wants detailed information about a specific command  
**When** they run `razd up --help`  
**Then** the system should display detailed usage information for the up command including examples
